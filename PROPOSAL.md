# My Personal Portfolio

## Description and Motivation

I've always been a fan of the modern and minimalist style. I want to capture that in my portfolio, but in a way that still allows me to have a good chunk of content on the page. I will have four main sections, the title, about me, projects, and contact info. The navbar will be in one of two positions, on the left when the display is large enough, and on the top when the display is not wide enough.

## Prior Art

When looking for inspiration for my design and layout, I stubbled across two previous BCCA student's portfolios that I really liked. The modern look of Adam Tutor's portfolio was near exactly the layout I was looking for, though I also liked Gillian Floyd's navbar, being on the side instead of on the top of the page.

I want to sort of combine the layout of Adam's portfolio with the side bar of Gillian's portfolio. I also want to change the layout in different ways, mainly the projects section. I don't like the look of the grid layout for the projects, so I will likely have a Python and HTML section, with projects laid out in rows below the section headings.

## Core User Workflows

- **Foundational Code:** Since we have only 3-4 days to work on the project, I want to get off on the right foot. This includes setting up the github repository, organizing my folder system, getting the base HTML code written, and creating the sections for each of the portfolio sections.
- **Content:** The portfolio, unfortunately (lol), has to have something on it to read. This workflow will mainly be copy/pasting onto the website, but it will also include spelling and grammar checks.
- **Resizing:** Once I have content to resize, I can start the trial & error process of making the content look nice on different screen sizes.

## Daily Goals

Each day lines up with the Core User Workflows.

**Tuesday:**

By Tuesday, I want to have the foundational code workflow done.

**Wednesday:**

By Wednesday, I should be working on finalizing the content that I want on the portfolio.

**Thursday:**

By Thursday, I want my website to look at least decent on other devices.
