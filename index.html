          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            I am a student at Base Camp Coding Academy, where I am learning to
            become a full-stack developer. From my time at BCCA, however, I have
            taken a keen interest in python, as I have gone off on my own to
            create numerous projects of my own on Github.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the longest time, I have always enjoyed seeing how things work
            and recreating them to the best of my ability, and budget. The
            process of a project turning from a vision to the final product is
            such an exciting and satisfying journey. Whether such a project is
            physical or software, the development cycle is something I enjoy to
            this day.
          </p>

            Back in high school, I was in the schoolâ€™s robotics team for the
            first two years of the team. During my time there, I worked with the
            team to push us to the regional competition in our first year, and
            all the way to state competitions the second. Being in the robotics
            team did not, however, stop me from focusing on school, where I
            graduated with the James M. Ainsworth Mathematics award for having
            the highest math average of my class of 225.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently most interested in back-end/software development,
            though I am also confident in my front-end skills using HTML and
            CSS.
